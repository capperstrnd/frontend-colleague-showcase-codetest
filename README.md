# Frontend Codetest

I had to submit both Backend and Frontend due to my base as Fullstack, and got informed that I didn't have to fully complete
the frontend portion - simple code enough to illustrate that I have the skills.  

## Instructions

Your assignment is to create a site to display all of our colleagues. We have a
whole bunch of user stories but in this first iteration we want you to handle a minimum of 5,
and no more than 7 of the available user stories found below. We want you to finish the ones
you chose as well as possible, rather than maximizing your feature count.

We want at least 1 story to be implemented from each of the requirement areas in the matrix
further below in this document, and the rest is up to you! Make sure the end product still
creates a somewhat user-friendly page though. Also, keep in mind that this is a chance for you
to display what you know and how you want to design your code.

You can either do a vanilla solution or use a **framework**, in either case, we expect a thorough
structure. Design it as if you were to hand it over to another developer for future
development. Everything needed to run the application must be found within the repository,
i.e. we do not expect to have to install for example a database manager if you have decided to
use one. Docker, however, is acceptable.

### Requirements

- Typescript
- Modern CSS, css-grids, min(), max(), clamp(), variables etc. 
    - Can incorporate modern CSS with SASS-like encapsulation

### Wireframe layout

- Page Title

- Filter/tool area full width

- Grid 4 frames wide with cards

- cards separated with a top/bottom section

- card top contains avatar pic

- card bottom contains name, office and social icons

## Notes and documentation

- Features and functional requirements, due to not having to completely finish this and spend a reasonable amount of time on this one I won't necessarily focus on hitting all of these points. Instead I might write a comment on how I would approach specific ones.

## Instructions

This base setup is created using `npx create-react-app . --template typescript` with

In the project directory, you can run:

To run it `npm start` and head on to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your favorite browser.
